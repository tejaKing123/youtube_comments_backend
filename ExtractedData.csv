SPOC Workshop on 14th July 2018,LIt9Q-P_2P8,"NPTEL Workshop for SPOCs (South Zone) - July 14, 2018

This workshop is meant for those SPOCs who belong to colleges in the South Zone (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Pondicherry). Similar workshops will be held for colleges in the other zones as well. 

NPTEL and the host Institute will jointly organize the workshop. The host college will invite 2-3 faculty members from colleges (both Engineering Institutions and Arts and Science colleges) that are within a radius of 150 km.

Expected outcome: The faculty are aware of NPTEL and how it can be used and can take it back to the Heads of their institutions for implementation in the best way to benefit their students. These members can also have a session with their students, where they can explain about NPTEL to them.",2018-07-20T12:14:22Z,170,7,8220,14

NPTEL - Knowledge is FREE,wJOESS9VSzw,"NPTEL is an acronym for National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning which is an initiative by seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for creating course
contents in engineering and science.

NPTEL as a project originated from many deliberations between IITs, Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) during the years 1999-2003. A proposal was jointly put forward by five IITs (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras) and IISc for creating contents for 100 courses as web based supplements and 100 complete video courses, for forty hours of duration per course. Web supplements were expected to cover
materials that could be delivered in approximately forty hours. Five engineering branches (Civil, Computer Science, Electrical, Electronics and Communication and Mechanical) and core science programmes that all engineering students are required to take in their undergraduate engineering programme in India were chosen initially. Contents for the above courses were based on the model curriculum suggested by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the syllabi of major affiliating Universities in India.",2018-04-19T06:45:37Z,1682,44,374212,151
